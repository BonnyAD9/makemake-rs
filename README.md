# makemake-rs
Create and load folder templates, now in rust.

This is overhaul of [BonnyAD9/MakeMake](https://github.com/BonnyAD9/MakeMake) in rust. This doesn't have all the features that the original has yet,
and it will not be compatible with both the original templates and the original config file.
